================
SVG Editor

## Features supported

- Add text layer
- Remove text layer (text or other shaped layers)
- Move/re-position layers (text or other shaped layers)
- Change Fille and Stroke color of any layer
- Save/export the file
- Because our imported image is always going to be so large, I think we need to be able to have it zoom out and maybe 
show at 25% instead of 100%
